# ðŸŽ¯ Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse & Analytics** portfolio project!  
This is my **first hands-on project** in data engineering and analytics, where I built a complete data warehouse and created insights using SQL and reporting tools.  

Itâ€™s based on the Medallion Architecture and follows best practices to show my skills in data processing, modeling, and analysis.

## ðŸ§± Project Architecture: Medallion Layers

We follow the **Medallion Architecture** which organizes data into 3 clear layers:

- ðŸ”¸ **Bronze Layer**  
  Raw data straight from the source (CSV files), loaded into **SQL Server**.

- âšª **Silver Layer**  
  Cleaned, standardized, and ready-to-use data.

- ðŸŸ¡ **Gold Layer**  
  Final business-friendly data in a **star schema** â€“ ready for analytics and reporting.

**Here's a quick look at the architecture:**

## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s in the Project?

This project includes:

- ðŸ”„ **ETL Pipelines** â€“ Load and transform data from ERP and CRM CSV files into the data warehouse.
- ðŸ§© **Data Modeling** â€“ Design dimension and fact tables using a star schema.
- ðŸ“Š **Analytics** â€“ Write SQL queries to generate insights into:
  - Customer behavior  
  - Product performance  
  - Sales trends
